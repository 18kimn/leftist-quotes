But in these circumstances it was impossible to restrict the quest to the mere form of consciousness. For the stage of philosophical knowledge is the richest in material and organisation, and therefore, as it came before us in the shape of a result, it presupposed the existence of the concrete formations of consciousness, such as individual and social morality, art and religion. In the development of consciousness, which at first sight appears limited to the point of form merely, there is thus at the same time included the development of the matter or of the objects discussed in the special branches of philosophy. But the latter process must, so to speak, go on behind consciousness, since those facts are the essential nucleus which is raised into consciousness. The exposition accordingly is rendered more intricate, because so much that properly belongs to the concrete branches is prematurely dragged into the introduction. The survey which follows in the present work has even more the inconvenience of being only historical and inferential in its method. But it tries especially to show how the questions men have proposed, outside the school, on the nature of Knowledge, Faith, and the like - questions which they imagine to have no connection with abstract thoughts - are really reducible to the simple categories, which first get cleared up in Logic.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL25","attribution":"Hegel, Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.

As the logical Idea is seen to unfold itself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the history of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and thus at the same time the poorest. The relation too of the earlier to the later systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the corresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier are preserved in the later: but subordinated and submerged. This is the true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of philosophy &#8211; the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by a later. Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative sense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything, has been set aside and done for. Were it so, the history of philosophy would be, of all studies, most saddening, displaying, as it does, the refutation of every system which time has brought forth. Now although it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted, it must be in an equal degree maintained that no philosophy has been refuted. And that in two ways. For first, every philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and secondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular stage in the evolution of the Idea. The refutation of a philosophy, therefore, only means that its barriers are crossed, and its special principle reduced to a factor in the completer principle that follows.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL86n2","attribution":"Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)"},{"body":"Pure Being, as it is mere abstraction, is just Nothing.

Looked at, however, from the side of universal mind qua general spiritual substance, culture means nothing else than that this substance gives itself its own self-consciousness, brings about its own inherent process and its own reflection into self.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm#m028","attribution":"Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)"},{"body":"That one learns from logic how to think (the usefulness of logic and hence its purpose, were held to consist in this &#8212; just as if one could only learn how to digest and move about by studying anatomy and physiology).","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlprefac.htm#HL1_26a","attribution":"Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)"},{"body":"Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot borrow its method from a subordinate science like mathematics.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlprefac.htm#HL1_27a","attribution":"Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)"},{"body":"Reason is negative and dialectical, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlprefac.htm#HL1_28","attribution":"Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)"},{"body":"The development of all natural and spiritual life rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlprefac.htm#HL1_28a","attribution":"Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)"},{"body":"It is this self-construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective, demonstrated science.

But in these circumstances it was impossible to restrict the quest to the mere form of consciousness. For the stage of philosophical knowledge is the richest in material and organisation, and therefore, as it came before us in the shape of a result, it presupposed the existence of the concrete formations of consciousness, such as individual and social morality, art and religion. In the development of consciousness, which at first sight appears limited to the point of form merely, there is thus at the same time included the development of the matter or of the objects discussed in the special branches of philosophy. But the latter process must, so to speak, go on behind consciousness, since those facts are the essential nucleus which is raised into consciousness. The exposition accordingly is rendered more intricate, because so much that properly belongs to the concrete branches is prematurely dragged into the introduction. The survey which follows in the present work has even more the inconvenience of being only historical and inferential in its method. But it tries especially to show how the questions men have proposed, outside the school, on the nature of Knowledge, Faith, and the like - questions which they imagine to have no connection with abstract thoughts - are really reducible to the simple categories, which first get cleared up in Logic.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_ii.htm#SL25","attribution":"Hegel, Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.

As the logical Idea is seen to unfold itself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the history of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and thus at the same time the poorest. The relation too of the earlier to the later systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the corresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier are preserved in the later: but subordinated and submerged. This is the true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of philosophy &#8211; the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by a later. Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative sense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything, has been set aside and done for. Were it so, the history of philosophy would be, of all studies, most saddening, displaying, as it does, the refutation of every system which time has brought forth. Now although it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted, it must be in an equal degree maintained that no philosophy has been refuted. And that in two ways. For first, every philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and secondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular stage in the evolution of the Idea. The refutation of a philosophy, therefore, only means that its barriers are crossed, and its special principle reduced to a factor in the completer principle that follows.","link":"http://marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slbeing.htm#SL86n2","attribution":"Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)"},{"body":"Pure Being, as it is mere abstraction, is just Nothing.

The existence of a national spirit is broken when it has used up and exhausted itself. This development is connected with the degradation, destruction, annihilation of the preceding mode of actuality which the concept of the Spirit had evolved. This is the result, on the one hand, of the inner development of the Idea and, on the other, of the activity of individuals, who are its agents and bring about its actualization. It is at this point that appear those momentous collisions between existing, acknowledged duties, laws, and rights and those possibilities which are adverse to this system, violate it, and even destroy its foundations and existence.
